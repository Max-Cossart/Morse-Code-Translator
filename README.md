# Morse Code Translator

## Demo

You can see this project [Here](https://morse-code-translator-sigma.vercel.app/)

## Requirements & Purpose

### MVP

- Create a UI that allows the user to input English and Translate it to Morse Code or vice versa
- Add unit testing for the translating functions
- Handle spaces properly

#### Bonus

- Have the test box auto detect the language that is typed

### Tech Stack

- HTML
- Scss
- JavaScript

## Design Goal

- Chose a color scheme I liked and tried to keep to it throughout the project
- I also like the idea of having it smaller and central on the page so gave that a go here

## Features

- A text area for typing either english or morse code to translate
- A button to make the translation happen or enter can also be pressed
- A small section below where the outcome of the translation is printed

## Known Issues

- When a large amount of text is translated it overflows the area provided
- When both english and morse code is input I don't like the way it is handled
- The color of the text in the text box may be hard for some people to see

## Future Goals

This project is complete for now and I wont be spending more time on it for now. I will instead be putting my time into new projects with a greater chance for learning.
